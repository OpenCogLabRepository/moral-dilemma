Moral Dilemma for activating DMN

after Ben Harrison et al

On the day of the experiment before scanning, verify that participants
can remember each of the individual vignettes. For the nondilemma condition, tell participants to simply recall the correct outcome of each scenario when voice prompted for a “yes/no” response by pressing the buttons either with their index finger (yes) or middle fingers (no). 
For the moral dilemma condition, tell participants that during scanning they will be asked to provide their own moral judgment to each of the dilemma vignettes in response to an audio
prompt, again by pressing the button either with their index finger (yes) or middle fingers (no). 

Vignette-specific audio prompts are prerecorded and programmed to occur 1 second after the visual
presentation of each vignette. The total stimulus interval for each visual stimulus is 5 seconds. Participants’ responses will be made within a 4-second window using
the response commands described previously herein.

The nondilemma and moral dilemma scenarios are presented as 4 x 30-second alternating blocks of 6 stimulus presentations per block, lasting 4 minutes total.
